    The basic premise of the app is to simplify and greatly speed up the scoring 
    process for the euro-style boardgame "7 Wonders. The app removes an second 
    guessing of who added up the scores, did they do it correctly, and most 
    importantly, does it quickly and easily.  It provides clear indicators of not
    just who won, but who performed the best in all the individual categories.
